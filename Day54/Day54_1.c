/*Q104: Write a Program to take a positive integer n as input, and find the pivot integer x such that the sum of all elements between 1 and x 
inclusively equals the sum of all elements between x and n inclusively. 
Print the pivot integer x. If no such integer exists, print -1.
 Assume that it is guaranteed that there will be at most one pivot integer for the given input.
